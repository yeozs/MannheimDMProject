7,  Pleasant flight which operated on time. Check-in at Changi was smooth and assistance given to me since I didn’t know how to use the check-in kiosk and bag drop. Lunch was provided onboard and advanced special meal requests were catered for appropriately. I like flying this airline.,0,1
11," This was my first time flying on a regional Singapore Airlines flight on a narrow-bodied aircraft since the old subsidiary Silk Air was absorbed by the parent carrier, and I was impressed. Everything went well on the flight, from boarding, to exemplary behaviour and courtesy shown by the cabin crew, to the food and boarding process at Changi airport. The inflight entertainment provided was the full product used for their long haul flights — amazing!",0,1
13,"  I was one of the last business class passengers to board, Went to my seat and no offer of pre departure drinks or hot towel. Japanese FA came to me and confirmed my meal order and informed me lunch service would start around 1130am. We took off about 0830am, after takeoff lights were dimmed and nothing was offered. From the time the aircraft took off to the start of lunch service around 11am I did not see crew in the cabin and nothing was offered for 2 1/2 hours. Lunch started with a drink order of orange juice. What came was a syrupy kind of orange drink like cordial. Meal service was fine but this set of crew was just not SQ standard. The regional seat was really uncomfortable and cramped. I did not like it and prefer the older long haul seat.",0,1
16,"  For my final trip booked for July 2024, Singapore cancelled my return flight from Istanbul to Sydney. Both the travel agent and I have been trying to get in touch via phone, sms and online forms and they are not responding at all. The travel agent no longer wants to know after a month and a half of trying, they sent me an email for me to try direct, Singapore will not speak to me despite my telling them the agent has wiped his hands of it. Today I found out I will not get my full refund if I were to cancel because the agent took out travel insurance on my behalf without advising me at all. I always have my own travel insurance why would I need another. ",0,1
20,"  Barely any room to move, woke up to getting my knee crushed from the passenger in front of me reclining there seat back and was told it’s within their right to do so. Would not recommend flying economy with them if you are 6ft or taller.",0,1
38,  An excellent experience. Food was simply terrific (Pan Seared Salmon) and plenty of Drink on offer. Service was Friendly and Efficient. I got a good 7 hours of sleep laid out flat. Also used their complimentary WiFi without any issues.,0,1
60," Check-in and boarding in Penang were smooth. The lounge in Penang was quite ordinary but completely adequate. On board, the window seat was very comfortable, though storage was limited. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal hadn't been loaded, so I was given a very bready pizza from Economy class. At Changi the Singapore Business lounge in Terminal 3 was vastly superior to those of most airlines, even when crowded. The process of boarding the A380 was smooth. The seat was comfortable and converted into a good bed, but a little tight around the feet. My vegetarian meal was delicious. The number of toilets in the Business section was limited, and there were Economy-type queues in the morning. The luggage was available quickly. Overall a very good experience.",0,-1
62,"  I cannot speak highly enough of the superlative service received on this flight. After I lost one earbud deep down into my seat the crew were determined to retrieve it for me - the lovely hostess thrust her wrist into the seat workings and fished out my earbud, sustaining some pain and minor abrasion. Unbelievable devotion to service! Every other aspect of the crew's service was impeccable as well. I can wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Airlines - I have just flown Economy Class from London to Singapore and the service was fabulous on that flight as well. I am writing this review on in-flight wi-fi - seems to be working fine, for the first time in my experience.",0,-1
74,"  Singapore Airlines impressed me with their outstanding customer service. Despite the unfortunate incident of my stolen passport, they rebooked my flight twice at no cost, showing exceptional flexibility and support. Their quick responses, transparent communication, and genuine care for passengers make them a top choice for hassle-free travel. Kudos to Singapore Airlines for turning a potentially disastrous situation into a shining example of world-class service. ",0,-1
80," I was looking forward very much to the experience on Singapore Airlines, and even more so, the A380. I was in the bulkhead seat in Premium Economy, so the very first row on the lower level. It was a nice smooth flight, The IFE was adequate, But I was a little disappointed with the level of service. I've always heard about how attentive ""The Singapore Girl"" (ie.flight attendants on SQ) were The service was far from the worst I have ever had on an airline, but not as good as I anticipated. Maybe I was comparing it to the absolute best service I have ever had on an airline I flew on my last overseas flight, a Taipei-based airline. Don't get me wrong, It was not bad at all - just not as good I was expecting.",0,1
82,"  My first time on a Singapore Airlines flight and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the gluten free meals offered, the variety of inflight entertainment, the excellence of service, the continuous cleanliness of the toilets and just the overall ease of boarding, flying and of course the airport!",0,1
88,  Worst business class seats. Why does SQ still have business class seats where the place to put your feet is not in line with the rest of your body? And the transition from bed to sitting is NOT a button push. Rather: Get out of seat. Flip seat with handles. Get back into seat/bed.,0,1
90,"  We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good, however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we won’t be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad.",0,1
103,"  
We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others  like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future.",0,-1
110,"  Flight I had with Singapore Airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival.  It’s inferior to Qatar Airways business class : underwhelming lounges, okay onboard catering, no dining-on-demand, quirky flat-bed seats (on the A350ULR and more so on the new A380), meager amenities onboard. The cabin crew is somewhat the only part of Singapore Airlines nearly on par with Qatar Airways.",0,1
111," 22 April flight from SG to Seattle. In all my experience flying with Singapore Airlines, this was the first time I saw more stewards than stewardesses on board. While the cabin crew service was excellent as usual, I would like to give a special shout out and thanks to Cheryl, Jessica and Crystal for their top notch service that is befitting of the Singapore Girl name. On the contrary, the inflight meal was a disappointment. From the menu selection and food quality to the presentation, they are not fit to be served on board an airline as prestigious as Singapore Airlines. The pandemic is over. It's time to revitalise the quality of your inflight meals.",0,-1
115,"  Used Singapore Airlines between Cape Town & Bali, check in at CPT very quick and polite as was security and immigration. SQ use the Bidvest lounge which was fine with decent food and seating, boarding was covered quickly so soon at my seat 12A. Once onboard drinks served before departing on time. This flight makes a short stop in Johannesburg where passengers remain on the aircraft, a small lunch served on the first leg by a nice crew. With a new crew departed JNB on time for the 10 hour flight to Singapore, food lunch/breakfast and service during the flight very good as was the seat and TV Options. Arrival in Singapore a little early after a pretty bumpy flight, transfer was fine using the Silverkris lounge in T3 for a coffee and shower before boarding the flight to Bali this time on a 787-10 my favorite SQ Aircraft. Departed a little late for this 2hour 20 minutes flight, crew very nice as was the food, bags delivered to the belt quickly all in all a great trip. I believe SQ are still up with the best. I guess the only thing missing is that amenity kit.",0,1
123,"  There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight. ",0,-1
136," Imagine a 14 hour trip being near perfect. Boarding, crew, food, seat, Wi-Fi, drinks, all of it. This cabin crew was amazing and managed to be sincere while also being efficient. They seemed to truly want to deliver the best and they did. 14 hours literally flew by in the lie flat comfy seat. The crew was proactive and seemed available whenever I needed something.",0,1
144," Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn’t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul.",0,-1
148,"  The flight seemed quite full with huge line up at the gate security area. No priority line but that’s ok. Boarding was odd with just a gate agent yelling out instructions. The seat was fine but no bottle of water which was disappointing. We used book the cook. My husbands beef cheek was tender but my steak was too tough to cut or even bite into. The crew were lovely but disorganised. The right side of the plane were offered bread after the meal not before. My side missed out entirely. Arriving at Ho Chi Minh city, no priority line for immigration. Never mind. It was a 5/10 flight. Nothing special.",0,1
166,"  Boarding while there is a power problem. So plane were no lights. Startup again power then no aircon! Delayed already, then excuse and safety demo. Then again captain still problems and sitting already one hour no aircon and just have to wait when or if they fixed it Serving warm water and while no aircon and still waiting to leave 22.00 hour. Last time SA for us.",0,-1
169,"  No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first.  From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time.",0,-1
172,"  Still my favorite airline. Best Economy Class !, spacious seats with nice legroom, pleasing color fabric on seat covers. Each seat had a pillow and a blanket. You should ask to offer you an amenity kit (with socks, eye cover, toothbrush / paste). Pity they do not have inflight magazine due to covid (same excuse to save money and weight, a lot of airlines are using the same excuse). Both flights were on perfect A350 and on time. After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was an icecream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream. One hour before landing the second meal was served which was as good and plentiful as the first. IFE was great with a good selection of movies and easy to use. Great airline, keep the good work.",0,1
175," The check-in process at JFK T4 was seamless. We got access to the Wingtips Lounge, which was fine but there was nothing to be excited about. Boarding was orderly despite the fact that there were many passengers (our A380 flight that night was almost full). On board, the seat looks nice and comfortable, though one of the windows is blocked by the seat design. Staff were nice and attentive, something you would expect from SQ anyway. The food was excellent (I booked my main course from the Book-the-Cook menu). The flight arrived in Frankfurt a bit late, but not a problem at all. Overall, this is what a good flight should be.",0,1
186,"  Our first flight was delayed more than one hour, so we lost our connecting flight. The new booking provided was horrible. I was travelling with my four-year-old and the new seat provided is far away, and we were separated. All the family members are separated for the whole journey. Miscommunication between the crew members made us to walk between the terminals for 2 times. Didn't get any help from the crew, even though we requested to provide a seat together.",0,-1
189,  Great flight! I arrived yesterday morning in Amsterdam after an almost 13 hours trip from Singapore with my wife and small son. Flying in the business class of Singapore airlines was an amazing experience. The seat is very convenient. In the night the crew prepares a bed for you which was fine. I ordered before the flight the lobster which was absolutely delicious. The service during the flight was great. The crew was very nice to my son and us. The breakfast was also ok. All in all this was one of the best flight experiences ever for me! Amazing flight and service!,0,-1
193,"  Nice flights, first leg got Premium Economy seat (but still normal Eco-Service) being SQ Gold. Nice hot meal as per the new concept for short flight with SQ. Long layover in SIN, could visit the new Silverkris Lounge and then onwards on SQ's new 737max. Very comfortable plane, nice interacting crew and lovely dinner served, watching a good movie on their in flight entertainment!",0,-1
217,"  I thought I had excellent service from both the ground staff and the staff on the plane, they really did go out of their way to help me. The only downsides were I thought the mediocre food. having to wear a mask the entire time on an 18 hour flight and the fact my tickets say changes are complimentary but they want to charge me the full price of a ticket to change them.",0,-1
227,  Very disappointing service from SIA. Plane was dirty departing SIN and staff communication was poor. Staff were curt to the point of thinly veiled rudeness. Lots of room for improvement here.,0,1
233," Since COVID, Singapore Airlines service has been going down and prices going up, Phnom Penh to Paris which was approximately between 2800 and 3300$ is now around 5 to 6000$. They don't give any more amenity kits or we may have to ask? Also, they do not propose anymore any drinks like Champagne before taking off. The lounge quality is also not like before, I presume Covid is an excuse for everything but we are still paying the price so what? We should accept it I presume. The quality of the company service is clearly going down, I hope they will improve that for going back to their best but before reading that they are I will certainly try another company to see the difference.",0,1
234,"  After spending a little more on the flight than intended after flying on this return journey with Singapore was happy I did as the overall experience was second to none. The check in at LHR was seamless even with the necessary Covid checks in place and being done efficiently by the check in staff. Boarding the plane I immediately became aware of the ""Singapore girl"" exceptional customer service the airline is known for. The food service was efficient and rapid and there was a wide selection of other snacks available with a fruit bowl also with crisps etc for during the flight. The flight to Manila was smooth, service was also great even in the smaller less crowded flight. The staff continued to deliver amazing professionalism and attention to detail. The attention to detail became very noticeable on the return flight from Singapore to London. After another comfortable and pro professional flight from Manila I boarded the flight to London and for reasons unknown, my booked seat hadn't been reserved.  I was one of the first on, as I prefer to also sit at the back of the plane, and I mentioned it to the cabin crew who immediately took me off the plane, against the flow of oncoming passengers (I was that guy and felt very embarrassed) took me to the ground staff who radioed to the gate to change my boarding pass to an aisle seat which they did without any fuss or questions asked. As I had now moved seats and there are only so many meals in the trolley to cater for the expected number of passengers in each specific areas on the plane, my moving now had to be factored in and to my surprise I overheard once cabin crew day to the other ""Mr Taylor has moved from seat 67f to 46h"". When I left the plane the cabin crew by the door said ""Thank you for flying, See you again soon Mr Taylor"" Overall Singapore airlines for me is hands down the best and aside from the ground team at Singapore airport the experience was amazing and I will definitely be booking my flights with them again. Hopefully to try out their world class business class.",0,1
235,"  The airline refuses to refund my ticket for May 2022. The request to instead rebook my ticket if a refund is not possible was also never replied to. I had contacted the airlines on april 20th via their portal and have not received any answer until now. I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fulfilled. I was told I could expect another call from a manager in the same week which did not happen.",0,-1
242,  There was no water or juice served for one and half hours which was ridiculous. Food serving was chaotic as crew moving back wards and forwards in a disorganised fashion. We ordered Hindu non veg meal and ordered meal were missing from the cabin crew list. Quantity of my food was horrific. Service was all over the place and chaotic. When I questioned they said there are 30 kids travelling on a full flight. ,0,-1
249," First time on SQ business for a very long time so we were excited to see what it was like especially during COVID. Compared to the Qatar the hard product is not as good especially the Q suite. The book the cook worked well with course by course service with the chicken satay as amuse bush. Meal was excellent by any standard as was the service. Where they went above and beyond was when my 2 year old son was feeling unwell, they assisted more than I would ever have hoped for. Flight was a bit more turbulent than normal due to the different route to avoid Russia and the Ukraine. The flight landed late due to a headwind. Luggage was out by the time we cleared immigration. Only downside was the lack of a touchscreen and selection of shows was not as good as I remembered.",0,-1
256,"  Trying to contact them by the call center is a nightmare with a lack of customer service and inefficient. The seats on this aircraft were the new regional business class seats which are not bad. The IFE is also good and we had 100MB free wifi which was nice. The crew were good. However, the food was an utter disaster. For a 7 hour flight, we were given 1 miserable meal which was rubbery eggs and mashed-up vegetables. Book the cook was not functioning on this sector so we had no other choice. No welcome drink either. Standards have gone down drastically from many aspects.",0,-1
266,"  I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don't transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines. ",0,1
269,"  I've never had a more frustrating experience trying to book a flight .. website saying unable to proceed, customer service tell me to keep trying different flights until one works. Then several credit cards declined. Customer service tell me to send an email, they say they'll call me back .. never do. Absolute frustrating mess!",0,-1
292," Melbourne to Singapore. This was our first time flying Premium Economy and my expectation was for Singapore Airlines was to provide an exceptional experience. Firstly the boarding in Melbourne was good, the ground and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Plenty of legroom and nice comfortable seats. Noise-cancelling headphones were supplied although my wife had to ask for them as they weren't at her seat. The back of the seat in front was a bit grubby and I used an antiseptic wipe to clean it, there were some other grubby bits around the armrest and tray table. Champagne was offered and gratefully accepted. The meal service was prompt although it was just an economy meal. I was hoping for something a little better as I paid double the economy ticket price. Wine was offered however only one red and one white, I don't like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus! The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customer-focused. Overall a good experience. Two things, ditch the Sauvignon Blanc and provide an upgraded Premium Economy meal.",0,-1
293,"  Jakarta to Singapore. I reschedule my flight the following day as day after is the lock down. I Top up more money for the ticket. I was confirmed on the morning 9.20am flight. However I received a email that evening that my flight for the next day morning was cancelled. Immediately there was no line, only you got to email. I have no choice but make it the next day for the night flight 20.20.  And true enough that morning there isn't any public transport, no taxi that day. I get the Hotel reception to assist. Upon check & reaching home, I learnt to appreciate our Singapore Airlines. They did it. I feel secure upon reaching the Jakarta Airport. A big thank you to Singapore Airlines. .",0,1
300,"  Makassar to Singapore. It took more time to Check-in since there’s Coronavirus concern in Singapore and they check our passport per pages because we are not allowed to visit or even transit In Singapore if you ever visit China in 14 Days, A little delay for boarding. The flight attendant is nice, the in-flight meal taste great. Singapore - Bangkok: First time using A350-900 and I like it, the aircraft still new and so fresh, The In-flight meal is good. Boarding time is great, on time.",0,-1
301," Flew economy Sydney to Singapore day flight. Very happy and a pleasant flight. Had a row of seats to myself. The A380 cabin was clean and did not look to be very old at all. Range of entertainment options was great. 2 meals served and had vegetarian which were both fine. Plenty of water offered and the crew were polite and professional. Despite news to the contrary, there were hot towels and blankets and pillows!",0,-1
330,"  Flew on Thursday 9th Jan 2020 from Singapore to Brisbane. Endured some turbulence flying out of Singapore for a few hours. I became nauseated and uncomfortable. Staff were very kind and helpful making sure I was looked after. Checked on me numerous times, throughout the flight. Very impressed with the cabin crew and would recommend flying with this airline in the future.",0,1
348,  Melbourne to Coimbatore via Singapore. Singapore Airlines has disappointed us in the last three trips. The price they charge is so expensive but from Singapore to our destination we get to travel in budget airlines which is Scoot or silk air. It doesn’t make sense at all. When we ask for help they say it’s a different management so we can’t help you further. Moreover there is no special assistance in those low cost airlines. Also the Singapore airport was so warm and the air conditioner was not controlled well across.,0,1
362," I have flown SQ a few times before, but find that the current A350 economy class seats are very uncomfortable, at least for a 6' person like me. BLR-SIN was a short haul flight which was even more tightly packed, SIN-MEL was marginally better. MEL-SIN was an older B777, which was far better than the new gen 350s in terms of economy class seats. I had booked SFML, but in every flight ended up getting a piece of tasteless, overcooked fish just dabbed with some tomato sauce - a big difference from my previous experience with seafood meal a few years ago. I do not think I will go for this option any more on Singapore Airlines. The flights were on time, the crew helpful, but overall my experience was far from being positive.",0,1
369,"  Melbourne to Singapore. First I flew in SQ and experience the lounges in both Sydney and Melbourne this month. I must say it's the worst experience I have ever had. Running out of food, decor bland and functional (barely) at best, staff sombre and angry. It is tragic for SQ to sell itself as a premium airline with such tired conditions. All in all disappointing experience on SQ",0,1
395,"  Seattle to Singapore. I was quite excited about flying the Singapore Airlines A350 in Premium Economy class. I chose the bulkhead (an additional $130 USD over the regular Premium Economy fare) as my seat.  I was disappointed with the seat. It was barely wider than an Economy Class seat, the leg rest might as well be non existent (it only extends about 3 inches), and there’s no dedicated lavatory for Premium Economy. Not to mention, the meals and cabin service are the same as Economy. Their so called Noise Canceling headphones aren’t noise canceling at all. I will pay extra for Premium Economy on EVA or Air Canada, but never again on Singapore Airlines.",0,-1
402,"  Jakarta to Singapore. I asked for a Vegetarian meal, but they gave us seafood instead. The fish is covered by pasta so we didn’t notice until my wife took a bite. Complain to one of the flight attendants, they said sorry, which to me isn’t enough. This is the 2nd time happens to me, not happy. Shouldn’t trust SQ that much.",0,-1
410,"  I flew from Jakarta to Hong Kong on September 19, 2019. The service was almost perfect. where the flight is very timely, excellent service from the cabin crew, wide space between seats. The only thing that is less comfortable in this aircraft is that entertainment on board still uses a remote system which makes operating the monitor more difficult than current full service airlines which almost all use a touch screen system. but for the whole, I really recommend you to fly with Singapore Airlines.",0,-1
434,"  Singapore to Delhi. This was our return journey on SQ406 (SIN-DEL) after we arrived in singapore 10 days before with them on SQ401 (which was definitely very good) Things took a U-turn here. The crew onboard was RUDE to the core. No courtsey, Zero on management. We were assigned seats at the end of the plane for 5 people. At the time of serving food, they served the entire plane before us, rows ahead of us and rows behind us, but did not offer us any food. after 2 hours of takeoff, with the entire plane almost dozed off after their meals, they came to us only to inform, they have no food available. Only 1 tray, that too with Fish. We were with a kid, hungry. Had we have known this, we would have had our own meal at the airport. On confronting them, they could only apologize. But somehow managed to get a veg tray from somewhere and we fed the little one. The entire journey we got nothing to eat! We travelled without meals.   6 hours journey. They had no remorse. Called them to serve water, they did not bother to serve it.  It was a nightmare of a flight. 4 of us were hungry throughout and were waiting for this nightmare to end as soon as possible. We could have done online checkin and booked our meals beforehand, but with the child, this is not possible to do so online and we had to do a manual checkin. Was this our fault? I don't think so.",0,1
436," Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed “glass” amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service. Having chosen to pay a significant premium over economy, it is disappointing that the enhancements provided by other airlines are not provided.",0,1
438,"  Singapore to Perth. Seat layout was 1-2-1, although no skybed for such a short flight. The seats were narrower but still comfortable. I fell asleep even before take-off and then woke up after to set my seat flat. Due to jetlag, I spent the entire flight asleep and the air stewardess asked if she could get me something else to eat when we were about to touch down. Great service. I will definitely fly Singapore again - although I am not sure if business class is worth the short trip.",0,-1
448,"  Munich to Singapore. Simply the best! Singapore Airlines really delivers a best-in-class experience – seat, food, and entertainment were all fantastic. But where SQ really stands out is service; I've never seen cabin staff put in such dedication and professionalism: they remembered passenger preferences and native language throughout the 12 hour journey, were always there if you needed anything, and even personally showed passengers to their seats in economy & helped to get bags into the bins. Premium Economy really delivers a competitive product: notably more space and comfort than Economy without the expense or extra frills of Business (I'm 6'0"" and couldn't touch the bulkhead with my feet even when I stretched out and tried). Most comfortable Premium Economy seat I've tried.",0,-1
455,"  Bangkok to Singapore . I was looking forward to flying Singapore Airlines and their new B787-10. I had set my expectations at the same level as Qatar Airways, seeing the fact that they are both 5-star airlines. With this in mind, I would firstly like to say that I was not impressed with Singapore Airlines, as they were quite inconsistent across the categories. The website is user-friendly, but I did encounter some glitches. Online check in is slightly confusing but I was able to manage. We arrived at Bangkok Airport 3.15 hours before our flight, and the check in counters opened 2.45 hours before the flight. It was extremely confusing which line is for which passenger, as they separate Business and Gold into different lines. In the end we were very quickly checked in at the gold counter. Luckily at that time of day security and immigration moved quickly. The Silverkris lounge in Bangkok is in a word, exquisite. The decor is very fancy and there is a manned bar with a barista making craft drinks and all sorts of coffee. Seats were plenty, clean and even the toilets are cleaned after every use! The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing, but I have come to expect that with all airlines. Boarding was extremely confusing, they asked gold members to queue up with business class but the sign asks them to queue up at the economy door. Not only that, they board business class passengers first then gold members, which makes a mess! Other Star Alliance carriers just board gold and business at the same time. Hassle free! I received a warm welcome at the door, and found my seat. The flight attendant was even kind enough to help my mum lift her suitcase into the overhead compartment! I would never expect a flight attendant to do it out of the blue! The seat was, in a word, horrible. It was so narrow! Qatar Airways also has 3-3-3 seating on their 787s, but it wasn't this narrow. I'm slightly large, but even my rather small mum sat shoulder-to-shoulder with the other passenger in the window seat! Legroom was fine. What I don't get is that these aircraft with small seats are being deployed on flights as far as Brisbane, an 8 hour hop. However, the bad seat was overshadowed by the service. On my outbound flight from Bangkok, I chose a seafood meal and got the same thing I get all the time flying Star Alliance out of Bangkok, mixed grilled seafood served with tomatoes, peas and duchess potatoes. The catering was provided by Thai Airways, and even had the Thai Airways logo on it. Needless to say, it was very nice. On my return flight, when coming around for drinks, the lovely flight attendant noticed me checking the white wine bottle to see what it was, and I love the way she asked if I wanted the Sauvignon Blanc rather than""white wine.  The crew on Singapore Airlines are fantastic, and very hardworking. Entertainment was adequate, I wouldn't be bored even on the longest flight. On the return flight, we checked in 7 hours before departure time as we wanted to explore Jewel. Absolutely recommended. The gold lounge in Terminal 2 was an absolute disappointment! Even the Thai Airways lounge in T1 is better! Other than that, this flight was almost identical, except for some very strong turbulence. Overall, Singapore Airlines is a good choice. If they can improve their seat and value their star gold more, I would be a returning customer.",0,-1
462,"  Singapore to Manila. Old plane with dirty interior.  The cushion was depressed so you are left sitting on a hard bench. Entertainment system rarely works and the crew don't care about anything. On these poorer routes, they use these older planes which means often they break down leaving you stranded. Really poor value for money and definitely not the quality airline of the past.",0,-1
492,"  Shockingly rude staff, I had flown Singapore as a child with the fondest memories. Had paid double our tour group and opted for Singapore over a low cost Asian airlines. Totally regretted it - staff so rude to the children. Food awful. No drinks offered except one with meal. Total waste of thousands of dollars,  our group had an outstanding experience with the low cost carrier.",0,1
500,"  I would like to express my gratitude for the superb service we received on our recent flight from Los Angeles to Mumbai via Singapore. We are two seasoned travellers, both very accustomed to long-haul routes. The A350 is a superb bird! It has to be said that the service provided in all four of the legs with Singapore Airlines was exceptional, from beginning to end (both on the ground and airborne); all staff where extremely professional, yet fun, friendly and accommodating to all passenger's needs. This cabin crew in particular who looked after us on the long, SQ37 flight from LAX to SIN on 14/03/2019, provided beyond exceptional service. They were actively and consistently attending passenger's requests, as well as checking that we were happy and well looked after, for what appeared to be the whole duration of the flight, or about 17+ hours. It was so satisfying and reassuring to see the dedication that this particular team had for their duties, as well as a clear love of the job. Great ambassadors for such well regarded airline such as SQ. We just simply couldn't had hoped for a more enjoyable journey. It is now clear to us that Singapore Airlines deserves to be the world's best airline. We are truly looking forward to our next Singapore Airlines journey, which we hope will take place in the near future - this new experience in air travel has opened a new and fascinating window in our holidays.",0,-1
509,"  Perth to Singapore. Dirty tray table, bad cabin crew, poor special meal. During the day flight the window shades on empty seats were up and cabin crew were not bothered to pull them down and a couple of passengers went to do it themselves in front of the cabin crew who just started blankly and didn't do anything about the remaining blinds that were up. On the way to Perth from Singapore I was given the dessert despite being on the special meal but on the return flight, the steward proceeded to pass it to me but then retracted his arm back when he saw I was on the special meal, and no explanation was given. It was not any vegetarian meal as well but why is there no consistency? Worst thing was there was no explanation and he just walked away.",0,-1
512,"  This was the first time my wife and I flew Singapore Airlines, what a wonderful experience! From check-in to deplaning everything went smoothly and on time. The cabin crew were superb. The service was attentive, food delicious, the cabin was attractive and very clean, including bathrooms. We flew United from Singapore to San Francisco, after our Singapore vacation, and the flight was no way near as good. Singapore Airlines will start flying direct from Seattle to Singapore non-stop in September 2019 and we definitely will use them when we visit Singapore again. P.S. We flew United on frequent flyer miles to India, and from Singapore to Seattle via San Francisco, Singapore Airlines is by far the best.",0,1
515,"  Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to London Heathrow. The cabin crew on this flight worked tirelessly to keep the passengers comfortable. They were smart, professional and extremely personable. I'd have liked it to have been warmer on board, still feeling cold even with a down jacket on. The plane now seems a bit tired with a couple of screens not working and a head rest which wouldn't stay up. I too would like to see considerably less plastic used.",0,-1
540,"  Travelled from Singapore to Auckland on the 10.25pm flight. Service aboard the flight was excellent. On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say, while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway, due to wind gusts, I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers, which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However, the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing. ",0,-1
554,"  My experience was less convincing. The reservation line was always busy and it takes ages to get through. The seat is large and comfortable to sit, but to sleep it is not comfortable at all: too hard, too narrow footrest and you sleep in a diagonal position which is awkward. I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad: very tough meat, overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time. Staff is friendly but not efficient, sometimes it takes ages to get some water or bread etc. Overall really disappointing experience. A pity as they used to be good some years ago. In any case I will not chose them again. ",0,1
559,"  Singapore to Newark. Cabin crew attitude, IFE & food were amazing. The only problem that I had with them was my Mileage Plus, both the cabin crew on the outbound flight and the ground staff in Newark barely knew anything about it. I asked the outbound flight crew about my Mileage Plus, they told me to consult the ground crew who just said both airlines are members of Star Alliance. He wasn't even sure if Mileage Plus members flying on Singapore Airlines were able to access United lounges. However he did tell me that Mileage Plus users (me inclusive) had to upgrade to Gold before accessing a Kris Flyer lounge but that seemed to be the only thing he knew about Mileage Plus.",0,-1
579," Hong Kong to Singapore. Everything about this flight is top notch. The seat was super wide and comfortable. Service was so attentive that sometimes I felt like I was being watched. Food was delicious and beautifully plated. One minor complain: I booked airport transfer through Singapore Airlines, and the car came early, but then the airline's check-in counter at HKG was not open until less than 2 hours before departure, leaving me wandering around the check-in area for over an hour. Despite this, I still think Singapore Airlines deserves to be the best in the world.",0,1

It was an amazing flight with a very charming service, with four flight attendants for us 20 people in the business class. They were always present, very friendly, every time with a smile on their face and fulfilled all wishes immediately. Everything was fine, from the champagne after entering the aircraft, to the excellent dinner with a lovely red wine until the Singapore Sling, which was served shortly before landing. Any time I would like to use this service again.",0,1
605,"  Midnight flight departing Singapore to London on A380 in economy class, not the favourite way to start a trip. Boarding was efficient and uncomplicated, although the sheer size of the A380 makes for a busy boarding process. We found ourselves on one of SQ's newest A380-800 aircraft, decked out in the new economy class setting with updated seating and AVOD. This configuration has economy and premium economy on the lower deck, and the very premium seats on the upper deck. We were in the 2nd most front row of economy, near to the galley. Seats were relatively comfortable (by Economy standards), with a new styled headrest. The AVOD was presented with a large touch screen, and is now line with the likes of Emirates. Food choices were pretty good (mostly edible), and service was pleasant, if not enthusiastic. We departed and arrived on time, and it was as tolerable as long-haul economy can be, I believe.",0,1
616," Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I flew Singapore Airlines with my spouse from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. We had booked the tickets around 3 months ahead which allowed us to get them at unimaginably cheap price. So given the overall quality of service we received was great bang for buck. We loved the interior which had nice Christmas decorations. The legroom was sufficient for an economy seat. The food on the menu was better than what I have had on most flights. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Our takeoff was slightly delayed due to issues with airport and I was afraid we will miss the connecting flight from Singapore. However, we were allowed to board the flight at Singapore even though we were 5 minutes late and the last passengers in! So they were basically waiting for us. I was very satisfied with the experience and I would love to fly again.",0,1
658," As Bi-annual visitors to Thailand, by recommendation, we went with SQ for a change having heard great things about Changi airport. This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ. On a positive note, they make it easy to decide who not to spend your time airborne with. Also, my wife is gluten free, although requested, she had to skip some meals because they didn't have the gf option for her.",0,1

683," We flew the 1250 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow. Push back on time but queuing on the taxiway for take off for another 25 mins before take off. The economy cabin was probably 60% full so we had 3 seats between the two of us. A few lucky travellers had 3 seats each so could get some reasonably comfortable sleep. The plane was clean. The set back TVs in excellent condition. The cabin temperature was just right too. Cabin crew very attentive and regularly came through the cabin with juices or water. The two meals were tasty as were the mid flight snacks of meat rolls, crisps and chocolate. As ecomony goes this has got to be one of the best offerings for long haul. However I would say that when the seat in front is reclined it is very intrusive into your personal space and makes watching your own TV screen uncomfortable. The only answers then for you too to recline your seat. If only everyone would just keep their seats upright! The outbound trip 3 weeks earlier was equally as comfortable. 5 stars all round!",0,-1
685," Singapore-Jakarta-Singapore in January. It's been 10 years since I flew Singapore Airlines and boy they've gone downhill since. Cabin service on both legs was really indifferent, especially on my evening flight back from Jakarta. Flown on many other airlines before but none except SQ offered me just ""coffee and tea"" during the meal service. Had to wait for another cabin attendant to pass by before I could get anything other than a hot drink. To a more discerning traveller it suggests cost cutting which is not cool. Inflight entertainment was mixed. Flight to Jakarta had one of the newest systems on the A350 but back home I was surprised to discover how far SQ is behind. No touch screen for the A330s in economy! Ground service was also a mixed bag - good in Singapore but underwhelming in Jakarta where my flight was delayed for almost an hour. No announcement and no apology until we we were all aboard. Can't fault their catering, which to my surprise was very good. Also, SQ android app is probably one of the best I've used and had no problem checking in for my flight on a phone. But my final verdict is that while SQ is not awful it's not that great or special either. Needs to improve a lot to catch up with airlines such as EVA and Turkish which I think are among the best these days.",0,-1
702,"  Kuala Lumpur to Zürich via Singapore. This was our first trip with our baby girl (6 months old). Sadly, as we landed in Singapore from Kuala Lumpur for Transit to Zurich, our baby had high fever. After checking in the clinic at T3 of Changi Airport, it was clear we couldn't continue our route. Instead, our baby had to go to a Hospital in Singapore. Ground staff assistance was great, Both the employees of Changi Airport as well Singapore Airlines helped us in every aspect. They unloaded and stored our luggage, helped us with immigration and the transport to the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the Hospital. During those days, we had steady contact with SIA. They rebooked our flight 2 times (as the doctors couldn't say for sure when our baby will be discharged) with no extra charge and being very supportive. As i understood, our price saver tickets gave them no obligation to do this for free - but to our great relief they did. They really gave us help and support in this hard time for us, showing us that even in todays world there is place for compassion. That there are times when paragraphs and formal rules are less important than the care for people in need and worry. We like to thank all the involved people from SIA and Changi Airport - you helped us when we needed it the most. Once our baby was healthy again and could be discharged, SIA helped us with our luggage and checkin in, making sure it all goes smooth. We had our bassinet seat, the flight in the A380 was good as can be with a baby. Onboard staff was attentive and supportive, food was OK.",0,-1
706,"  Sydney to London via Singapore. First time I've flown with this airline since 1991, and I couldn't fault the flights at all. I'm reasonably tall (5'8"") with long legs, but I had plenty of seat room. Service was exemplary, and I liked the extra touches of menus and the little convenience bag, containing socks, toothpaste and toothbrush, and an eyeshade. Food was pretty good, and the entertainment choices excellent. Despite a tight connection in Singapore (50 minutes) I still had plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again.",0,-1

Secondly, the seating is very generous in terms of comfort and space. The business class on a Airbus 350 could compete with some first classes on other airlines or older airplanes. The entertainment on board is up to date and there is plenty of choice for those who can not sleep during long flights. Food is excellent, staff are nice. It's worth it.",0,-1

771,"  Denpasar to Singapore, my experience has been disappointing. The lack of pillow and blanket on board was a concern, even though it was just a short flight, and the fact that it was a day flight didn't mean that blankets were not necessary. The cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked the crew for a blanket, the reply I got was they have run out.  When the flight was approaching Singapore, we demanded for some disembarkation/embarkation cards, we only managed to get 2 for a total of 8 of us, because they have run out of these cards. In the end, we had to queue up before the immigration counter at Changi Airport to get the cards and to fill them in. The meal was very unsatisfying. Overall, the flight was just full of disappointment.",0,-1
778,"  London to Melbourne via Singapore. The premium economy is not really impressive. The seats are a bit bigger, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather have a window seat in economy and wedge myself into a comfort. It is handy if you want to do some work on your laptop during the flight, but not if you want to sleep. Singapore Airlines is a reasonable premium economy class option, but not as good as Qantas. The food is standard economy which I think should be expected. The extra money is paying for the seat. But I battled in it and didn't find the extra space that worthwhile.  The Wifi on SIA is an absolute joke. It was $10 for something like 50MB. I had to reload twice during the flight. Overall, I didn't think it was worth the price. If you are going to dig your hand into your pocket and spend money, go business. If not, grin and bear it in economy.",0,1

785,  Guangzhou to Singapore. Singapore Airles has lost its service quality. Its virtually impossible to use my hundred of thousands KrisFlyer points for upgrades. The required ticket type is nearly the cost of the business fare in the first place!! Points have been progressivly devlaued with unecessary expiry dates. SQ is locked in the past. The budget airliens are beating it on service standards. There was a time when SQ was my preferred carrier. Sadly its no longer the case. The outdated one way vs two way ticket cost differential means I use other airlines more and more frequently becuase I need the flexibility in rescheduling flights. SQ should look at Jetstar Asia if it wants to see what modern customer standards are like. (Believe me I never thought I would write in favour of Jetstar.),0,1

My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us - myself and our 3 teenagers - decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra $437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This, when asked, amounted to about $30 each! So I won't be flying with Singapore Airlines again and suggest you check the cost of your tickets to see how much extra you will be paying to stayover",0,-1

Singapore Airlines new route Singapore - Canberra - Wellington - Canberra - Singapore. Flights to and from Singapore are overnight flights departing 23.00 from Singapore and midnight from Canberra to Singapore. Old plane but has 34 inch pitch in economy, heaven compared to other airlines 31-32 inches. Seats are quite firm but a good 19 inches wide. In both directions the meal is only a snack with a drink after takeoff, served really quickly to be able to turn the lights off. Extra drinks only on request. This allows Wellington passengers to get some sleep as they have already had a 3 hour flight to Canberra and a 1 hour transit. Breakfast is generous served with coffee and tea refills. The other bonus for this flight for Canberra residents is not having to get to Sydney or Melbourne and not having to deal with Sydney airport. For many Canberra residents it is only a fifteen minute drive to Canberra airport, check in is fast as it is the only flight out. With internet check in it is a bag drop. You can leave home two hours before take off and be in the departure lounge with time for a drink before boarding.",0,1
856,"  Singapore to Houston via Manchester. Flight left Singapore on time and cabin crew provided hot towel followed by drink and light supper after take off.  FAs patrol the cabin with water, juice and snack runs every 15-30 minutes and very helpful when I requested additional drinks. They turned the lights back on and started the hot towel, drinks and Breakfast service before we arrived in Manchester. Flight deck communication was adequate; we know we were ahead of schedule and can expect that Manchester is foggy and cold when we arrived. Entertainment system was a slightly older one without touch screen but still contains more than enough movies, TV series and games to keep passengers entertained. The flight left Manchester behind schedule but arrived on time in Houston. Fresh set of crew got on board from Manchester going to Houston. There is one FA that we knew from our previous flight 2 weeks back between SIN-CGK; back then she mentioned she'll be in this flight and she was! She was one of the better crew members in our past flight and her bright and cheerful personality shines through in this flight as well. Even though other FAs in this flight to Houston were also polite, courteous and helpful as expected, but most of them were not as personable and does not exude a warm personality in giving their service. Most of the FA on this flight tends to give mechanical service and you can feel that they are here to perform as expected, but missing the part where they should be able to engage their customers in a more personal way. However they did a great job in providing their services throughout the flight, keeping us full with three meal services and drink-snacks in between, also keeping the restrooms clean and well-stocked. Flight deck communications are adequate; we were informed about possible turbulences along the way so we can prepare, the time we will be arriving in Houston and also the local weather informations.",0,-1
882,"  Flew Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Singapore. Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one. I found the IFE content rich and diverse, especially the music library - I enjoy listening to music while watching the moving-maps. I didn't use the WiFi, thus unable to comment. The flight attendants patrolled the cabin two to three times between meals with professional manner and meticulous grooming. All in all, this flight demonstrated Singapore Airlines high standard of service.",0,-1
888,"  In September / October 2016 I flew with my wife around the world using in sequence Virgin Atlantic, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines. All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service. ",0,-1
891," Ho Chi Minh city to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit. After having such a great experience on the initial trip I felt let down. Still quite good but I felt I could have been with any other airline. I wish there was more consistency. I would still opt for them though at least outbound.",0,1
896,"  Singapore to Brisbane on Singapore Airlines on a group of around 40. As a leader of the group, I have requested through my travel agent an aisle seat at the back of my group members so that I can facilitate and coordinate my group easier. I checked in at Changi airport Terminal 3 as the first person in my group. When I told her that I had requested an aisle seat of the back of my group, she rejected with an unsmiling face and said there was no choice of seats for group travel. Throughout the whole check-in, she was smile-less. The check-in was unpleasant.  My co-leader checked-in in another counter as the last person in my group. The counter staff was a lady who was more willing to help to look for aisle seat for my co-leader. Onboard, the cabin crew was pleasant and diligent in giving out water/juices in between meals. Seat room was sufficient. Lots of movies available for watching. The meals were average. Apart from the disappointing ground service, I am pleased with the service onboard.",0,1
921,"  Bangkok to Singapore. My IFE unit screen was not working as the screen went fuzzy and shaky when turned on. The FA tried to restart my system but it did not fix it. As no other seat was available, I was struck with no movie entertainment except for the music for the whole flight. Crew on this flight of the Singapore Airlines standard. They did the usual greeting when boarding, pre-flight drink and hot towel. Hot Towel is something not many airlines offer. Bangkok is not one of the country where you can book the cook, but the foods were not too bad with a Thai dessert on the tray. The cabin is clean even though this is relatively old plane. That might explain why the guy 2 rows in front of me also has the same problem with the IFE unit. Overall, it is an average experience.

939,"  Singapore Airlines from Hong Kong to Surabaya via Singapore on an A380 and A330. A380 is really enjoyable plane, cabin is huge. Cabin staff very attentive, toilet was clean, amenities superb.  I was a little bit disapointed about the food, for moslem just only 1 choice - just chicken. My boy under 2 years got toys but not get food. The entertainment is like the A330, need upgrade for the movies.",0,-1
940,"  I had an unpleasant trip back to Singapore from Hong Kong. Firstly, the boarding time was 7.15pm. We ended up boarding at 7.30pm. Secondly, the cabin crew were not that friendly. Thirdly, the whole entertainment system was down about 3/4 of the time. Yes, they compensated us with a $75 gift voucher but the fact is this was my first time with Singapore Airlines and there were so many problems. Before take off, the TV that was supposed to show us the safety procedure was disrupted by a technical error. The food was not that tasty compared to Korean Air (who I was flying from Korea to Hong Kong). The ticket I bought was cheap but I believe service could be better.

957,"  Flew Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore. I found the flight very enjoyable and on par with previous flights with Singapore Airlines. Check in on both the going and return trip was smooth and pleasant. The theme was reflected across the rest of the flight meaning at no point was I left feeling stressed or perturbed. I especially enjoyed the return flight from SIN to DXB since they had used a newly refurbished 777-300ER which had all the new bells and whistles, incl. touch screen IFE and refreshed seats. While I did not use the in-flight Wi-fi, it was good to know it was available and operating.",0,-1
967,"  Flew economy on Singapore to Kuala Lumpur return this week. By chance, both flights used the new A350-900 fleet. For such short route, I guess it's partly to test the new planes. Not too bad an experience on the new planes. Smooth, steady and quiet in the air, a beautiful looking plane especially the signature long and curvy wings and rather cool batman-looking cockpit window. Leg space is larger than other economy class.  Noisy wheel box and luggage compartment mechanisms (on both flights so it's not a coincidence).  Insufficient aisle clearance as you pass through premium economy cabin so we had to literally hand carry our hand carry luggages at that stretch of the aisle. Noticed that cabin crew was struggling to find space to put hand carry bags into the overhead compartments.  Other than the beautiful outlook and smooth cruise in the air, the interior comfort falls short of expectations.",0,-1
993, Doha to Goa in Business Class on Boeing 787-8. This 3 hours flight was on time. Business Class seat configuration was the older product (no Qsuite) but very comfortable nevertheless. Flawless onboard service that we have come to expect from Qatar. Summary: it doesn't get better than Qatar Airways in Business Class.,0,1
1020,"  I find Qatar Airways to be my favorite airline at the moment. The whole experience from booking to traveling, to end destination is very professional and easy. I had to make changes to my return journey, so I called Qatar (after hours my time), my call was answered straight away, the lady said that she could make change for me (AUD $60) or alternatively I could do it myself online (AUD $11). I chose to change myself online, very easy. As for my flight this week, PER-DOH-LYS, it was great, even though it was in economy, the food was much better that other airlines flown recently. I'll definitely be choosing Qatar where ever possible in the future.",0,1

1038," Doha to London Heathrow, 10th October 2023. 777ER which is always a bit cramped now that most airlines have squeezed in 10 abreast - noticeably less spacious than the Qatar A380 which is also 10 abreast. Cabin was clean and well-maintained and took a while for the air conditioning to kick in after engine start up, but when it did, wow it was cold! I normally like a cool cabin, as its possible to get warm with a blanket etc., but impossible to cool down if the cabin is too warm, but this was a bit far on the cool side, even with a blanket - maybe it was just me though? IFE is exceptional on these updated/more modern cabins and aircraft was kept clean throughout, including the washrooms. Despite many airlines simplifying food provision since Covid, the food was great, particularly the dessert which as well as being tasty, had a white chocolate in the middle, complete with Qatar branding! Bang on time and unlike every recent experience at Heathrow (my record being a 2.5 hour wait), bags arrived promptly. Could fault anything on this trip aside from the usual gripe about the cramped 10 abreast 777 cabin; great service, clean aircraft, great food, on time departure and arrival.",0,1
1051,"  The flight from Bangkok to Doha was on the A380-800. The flight from Doha to Vienna was on an Airbus A320. Both flights were on time and the staff on both flights were very professional and friendly. The food options were above average, and there was a good choice of drink options. I did notice that the entertainment system seemed to have a lot less choice of content than when I last flew Qatar Airways, and the leg room felt a little tighter. Arriving to Doha around 11:00 pm meant a huge crowd waiting to get through security. Doha airport is OK. The flight back to Europe meant taking a bus to the plane and this was a bit of a pain. Both flights were completely full. At Bangkok, I asked at the check in counter whether it was a full flight and the guy behind the desk said that it was overbooked. I guess the remaining passengers got to fly on the next Qatar flight to Doha, which left just an hour and a half after my flight. T I will still fly Qatar Airways and I will still recommend them.",0,1
1055," The First Class lounge in Doha is amazing and then we went on a VIP bus to the plane which actually took longer than the flight. The front cabin on the plane which they called First it wouldn’t qualify for even a C class in Europe.  The take off and landing were immaculate, the pilot was amazing and food was ok. That is all I can say about a 55 minute flight.",0,-1
1083," I asked for a low salt menu, instead of actual food and desserts I got mostly small portions of vegetables (cucumber, tomato) and fruits. I don't think chocolate cakes or tiramisu have salt in them and excluding them from my menu was a turn off. Also the portions of my food were very little. ",0,-1
1093,"  Overall, the flight was pleasant. Flying with Qsuite from Jakarta to Doha was exceptional. The cabin crew was friendly, helping a lot, always checking with us if we need help. The Food taste is just amazing for my 2 meals. The Entertainment also updated and had a lot choice for a long trip. Just like mini apartment when flying in Qsuite. Unfortunately, from Doha to PHL, they changed that into regular Business Class in 2-2-2 Configurations. The services are still great for 13 hours flight.",0,1

1109,"  First time flying Qatar Airways and definitely the last time. Seats were great and staff was also great and that is the only positive thing about the flight. But the IFE system did not work on my flight. The Ground staff was bad in New York, but ok in Doha. Flight was delayed 30 mins because of technical issues without further information. ",0,1
1118," Every time the food was disgusting!! The desserts are basically yoghurt!! Seriously yogurts are desserts?? I flied from Boston to Qatar. Qatar to Dhaka and then return from Dhaka to Qatar, Qatar to Boston. Almost in every meal food was not tasty! Disgusting foods! Means Qatar does not have good food culture! The bread they provide is so hard, that even the dogs of USA will not eat! My kids couldn't eat anything from the flight. My son has autism so we signed for the DPNA code. When we checked in looked like the staffs do not even know what is that! I didn't find any special accommodation for DPNA code provided by the Qatar Airways. We had hard time making them let us take the stroller with us as we had 8 hrs transit time in Qatar! I traveled so many other airlines. Emirates is still the best. No where near them! I will give it 2 star!",0,-1
1123,"  Flight on time. Smooth cooperation with their partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. Luggage transfer went smooth, arrived quickly in Hanoi. In Doha I had 12 hours layover; I was eventually denied a hotel stay but had lounge access to their decent Platinum lounge. Onboard, recognised as elite traveller and was well pampered by professional attendants. They secured me 3 seats in a row by applying seat-block for me as elite flier. The plane was not fully occupied as this is a new, additional flight on this route. IFE of high class and movies renewed frequently. Food onboard improving for QR: 3 offerings at dinner, of which I had two dishes of beef, which was excellent. Beers were of ridiculous poor quality, wines were fair, including a sparkling Spanish cava. The wineglasses are so small that they embarrass the passengers. They hold 5-8 cl only. The wineglasses on my previous flight, Rwandair, are 4 times larger. Amenity kit given though rather useless. A hot snack was offered before morning landing in Hanoi. Recommended, can't demand much more for economy class. But bring onboard your own slippers, and headset. Qatar Airways' tickets have become too expensive during Corona.",0,1
1159,"  I love QR's Q Suites. This was the second sector of a flight from the UK. As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear. When so much else is so good, this is surely a major error on an overnight flight. It certainly left me in a less than good mood",0,1
1181,"  I booked Gatwick to Cape Town via Doha return. I was told that the first sector was a code share from LGW to Doha and would be operated by British Airways I reluctantly accepted this. I got told that on the return journey the Doha to LHR this sector was also going to operated by BA. At this point I told Flight Centre I wanted to cancel all the flights and get a full refund. My travel agent then came back with an offer to change the flight back to a Qatar Airways flight from Doha and to Gatwick which I accepted. We flew on LGW to Doha which was as expected a very average Club experience on an old style BA plane. Doha airport was a nightmare, badly signposted, heaving with people,  Wi Fi was rubbish a very poor experience. Doha to Cape Town in the Q suite is a very nice way to fly. Better than BA first class in many ways. It lived up to expectations and was good news. The day before our return to the UK, received an email from Qatar saying another change of plane and no Q Suite. Could not delay flying back due to commitments. The seat was hard, lumpy and uncomfortable and did not properly go into flat bed position. The staff on board were hugely apologetic but there was nothing they could do. A pretty poor flight to Doha, where we then found the main business class lounge closed and everyone packed into another lounge. The flight to Gatwick not a Q Suite but it was a reasonably modern plane with good service. I wrote to Qatar Airways saying I had not received what I had booked and paid for and got a very polite letter back saying they were not prepared to give me any compensation whatsoever. ",0,1
1183,"  I bought a round trip business class Lite ticket under the expectation that it would be Q-Suite. I selected my seats in Qatar Airways seat app, which showed the Q-Suite layout. At ATL  check-in I was told that there was an operational issue and the aircraft had changed with an old business class seat. This happened on my return from DOH to ATL leg. As for DOH to BLR and BLR to DOH, we did get a Q-Suite and it was as expected. ",0,1
1184, Wow what an incredible experience with Qatar. I was lucky enough to experience the Q- Suites and I wasn't disappointed. From the moment I checked in I was made to feel special which made my trip even more memorable. I will most definitely use Qatar Airways again and thoroughly recommend their services. Thank you Qatar.,0,-1
1186,"  Take off was 2140 and my food was served approx 2330. Kids meals were awful, and my children wouldn’t touch it. The meal service finished approx 45 mins later, lights went off, only for the lights to come on 2 hours later to serve a pastry. So we are wide awake and another 2 hours to go in the flight. Finally landed in Doha exhausted. Thankfully the crew and service were more prompt on the next leg, but my food was awful. Kids were served egg wrap and as there were no meat choices when crew came to us I was served a veg dish which was awful. Doubtful I will choose to fly Qatar again.",0,-1
1197,"  From arriving at the airport on our journey and throughout the cabin staff were run off there feet, and are a credit to the firm. Very pleasant and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Having read the baggage policies many times, and cutting our baggage to a minimum, I was appalled at how many people were over the limit on size, number and weight of the cabin luggage. The cabin staff are having to struggle on moving bags around to get everybody accommodated, they should not be lifting these overweight bulky items to a level higher than they are. Then having to pacify a complaining passenger whose bag was more than the accepted size because they had to move it further down the cabin. I would like to say a big thank you to all the cabin staff that delivered great care and devotion to all in my section D/E 31, They worked wonders.",0,1
1219," Quite good airline. However they sometimes miss-schedule the flights due to very heavy traffic in their own HQ airport - Hamad. Be careful if you have a short transiting time. The aircraft are normally big and well equipped. Inflight entertainment are also very good. Check-in times are fast and easy, you can check-in very early at HIA with Qatar airways. However the prices are expensive",0,1
1226,"  Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page.",0,1
1228,"  I booked for the first time economy with Qatar Airways, knowing its a relatively short flight (5:40 min flight). I usually fly business class on longer distance flights with Qatar airways. Quality of service was impeccable and friendliness of staff as well. Same goes for cleanliness of cabin interior and toilet. I took about 10 flights this year with different airlines and Qatar Airways clearly stands out in quality, at check-in as in flight experience.",0,1
1230,"  The flight operations and service on board were very good and we were overall happy with that. The food was great and the flight crew very polite and friendly. The transit in Doha was generally ok, but the flight information was somewhat misleading (several flight numbers pointing to the sams flight, no information that the flight stops on route to a different final destination). Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad. Our bag was broken upon arrival and we couldn't even find a complaint form on the website, or some E-Mail address.",0,1
1249,"  Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old.

The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes.",0,-1
1254,  We flew in Business Class from Zurich via Doha to Cebu on October 18. On both flights the service was excellent and the crew were very friendly and professional. The food has improved from previous flights. The flight from Zurich to Doha used an outdated aircraft from CX that did not meet QR standards. The light above the seat did not work and the information system was outdated. Boarding in Doha was once again chaotic. Business class passengers were not well informed and called while economy passengers were boarding. The bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action. We were crammed into a bus with the rest of the passengers.,0,1
1270,"  Good experience overall. Food is good, service and comfort is good. The aircraft was clean, on time and they have very pretty containers for child meal, which we kept as gifts. I liked the DOHA airport as well. I used the onboard wifi on my way back. It was decent. I The speed was on a lower side but I wasn't trying to stream anything. The options in the movie selection were good. What i would recommend is to have better ""Flight Map"" options. Like some other airlines provide option to change view of what you see in flight map. Also the repeated commercial pages in flight map were annoying. Please leave that experience without ads. ",0,1
1288,"  Ground Staff at Heathrow were very efficient. 10 min Check-in process with COVID-19 documents checked within the line so you are ready when at the actual counter. Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time. Upon arrival in Pakistan the Ground Staff were also quite helpful (Not Pakistani, the Qatari staff) assisting to all passenger concerns in baggage claim. I will be flying Qatar again next week to Gatwick via Doha - Qatar has always been excellent in the 50+ flights I have taken with them. Never fail to impress me. Thanks to Qatar Airways. And all cabin staff on QR4 (04/09) & QR614 (05/09)",0,1
1294,"  Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter.

The planes are modern and clean with excellent inflight entertainment, professional staff and reasonable food. The inflight magazines, the fresheners and menus have disappeared due to the pandemic. But the food portions, although smaller, are reasonably tasty and the staff still keep the lavatories clean with good overall service.

They checked the tag of the bag and everything related to the bag and they couldn't know where is it. The guy said it shows that its loaded but we cant find where it is.

The flight we were transferred to was a 3 stop Qantas/BA flight - we had originally paid extra for the 1 stop flight. The new flight time was 37 hours and on top of that it took 3.5 hours to check in at Manchester for a 45 minute flight to London. We have since submitted a request for compensation for additional costs which includes the extra we paid for exit row seats on our Qatar flight which we never got. Trying to get updates on the compensation request is impossible, you just get another automated message if you email, the customer service phone number team says it’s not their department and they can’t help, the online chat team says it’s not their problem, they can’t help and tell you to wait - when you ask for an escalation point they shut down the chat.

1328," I have been a strong supporter and promoter of Qatar Airways up until this past return flight that my wife and I took from Doha to Athens (28th June 2022) and return (27th July 2022). The outbound flight crew were awful and the cabin service was poor, the crew appeared tired and 'hassled' and were not at all friendly. They did not appear to be fully trained as the usual and past cabin crew have always been, the food was really poor and tasteless. We took advantage of an upgrade offer (QR3900) for our return journey to Doha hoping to enjoy a better quality service upon our return. It proved to be anything but. Firstly the Business Class Lounge catering to Qatar Airways Business Class passengers was closed? We went to other lounges but they were full and would not accept us, eventually we found a lounge that did offer us seats in their reception area. The snack food was truly below par, so too was the extremely poor selection of beverages. We boarded on time and the crew were definitely better and friendlier than our outbound flight, the menu appeared OK but when the food was served it was not up to the Airlines usual standard. I had only a mouthful and could not eat the rest, the chicken that was served to my wife was overcooked and extremely tough. So from a clear '10' that we would rate on all of our previous flights with Qatar Airways our rating on this recent experience would be 4/10.",0,1
1340,"  Fantastic experience with Economy class on Qatar SFO-MAA-SFO in June/July 2022. A350-1000 is one of the most modern planes in operation. The seats were very comfortable despite their thin appearance. There was no tailbone pain during the 15 hour trip from SFO to DOH. There was enough leg room in the first row after business class - Row 16. The best seats on this plane are 31A and 31K as there are no seats in front of them and you get a window too. The next best seats are 17C and 17H, those are aisle seats with no seats in front. Qatar' economy food was pretty good and sufficient. The AVML choices are offered in the standard menu so no need to order special meals. The quality of food was surprisingly good in all segments. Not too oily, spicy. Doha airport gets too crowded in the central area, which is the only downside in the whole trip. The service onboard was pretty good with the crew being quite responsive to your needs.

We have not received one single update since our luggage got lost, although the baggage service assured us it would take maximum 72h until our luggage will be sent to us. Also claiming our lost luggage directly at Brisbane airport baggage service and filling out all the necessary paperwork has not helped us in any way.

When I arrived to Doha, the customer service didn’t offer me anything for this inconvenience. This is while the layover was from 12am until 8am, the worse time to stay awake specially with a shock of not knowing and being prepared. I have to mention that the flight and flight attendants were amazing but the airport staff were rude, not helpful and made me and so many other wait at the counter with no response for 40 min at a time while refusing to respond to our concern.

When waiting to board the flight there was no priority lane for business class passengers. Once I had boarded, I would have appreciated a better welcome and more information regarding the services on board. Unfortunately I was mostly ignored by staff when I got into my seat except when I had the do not disturb sign on. I was awakened as the air steward who he needed to know my meal preference. It was a 14 hour flight. I do not understand the urgency from the staff. It defeats the purpose of even having a do not disturb sign.  I was not offered any bedding on the flight. ",0,-1

The agent at the boarding gate at Cairo assured us that we'll get accommodation taken care of once we arrive in Doha. In Doha, the customer service in the Transfer area was far from professional. They kept us waiting for 2-3 hours in the transfer area, and refused giving us any rooms claiming that Egypt is red listed due to COVID.  They refused to give us access to lounges to get some rest before our 15 hour flight. They said they're not responsible for what the agents said in Cairo, and they didn't witness the conversation.  3 meal vouchers were added to the boarding pass, two of them worth 30QR, and the third worth 60QR.

1415,"  Overall experience was very disappointing. Both my flights to and from were delayed and made me miss my connecting flights. They gave my seat to another passenger on my connecting from Doha to Dubai, and the customer service counter was very unfriendly. I had to wait 7 hrs for the next flight, and all they gave was a food voucher for a food court.",0,-1
1427,"  A last minute downgrade of aircraft. Almost all my Qsuite bookings over the last few years changed due to aircraft change to inferior business class seats.  On the ground in Doha all 4 flights used buses to and from the aircraft. It is not a big deal for arriving in Doha, but the departure area for remote aircraft is like always crowded, often no seats, shouting and screaming of gate staff, since no loudspeaker announcements.  I noticed this time a decline in onboard services, I requested not to eat, just to keep my glass of water full. This did not happen. On the 5hr flight from Doha to Warsaw, there was no set of earplugs in the kit, just socks and eyeshades. Catering was as usual very good, and they finally got rid of that bad safety video, which I had to endure for so many years. As a longtime Qatar Diamond to tier member, I have been a huge fan of the carrier, but I am concerned about the declining standards.",0,-1
1436,  The airline has very great staff and it is cheap because I went with economy and the seat comfort was so cozy. The ground service was very fast and the food was so tasty. I was very happy with Qatar Airways.,0,-1
1438,"  At checkin the staff said that we had upgraded to Business class for the DOH-MLE route and hadn't paid, so if we were to continue, we would be charged accordingly. This was not the case. When I quizzed how I could possibly have upgraded without paying, they agreed I couldn't have. A very helpful member of staff re-issued our tickets in economy after phoning reservations and after over an hour stood at checkin. No fault of his and he was a credit to the company. On board I felt the staff were efficient but never over-friendly and it was an hour and a half before we were even offered a drink. The whole experience was mediocre at best.",0,1
1440,"  I wanted to pay and upgrade my seat to one with extra legroom for Doha to Seattle leg, I asked in Chennai Airport and they said they couldn't do it and asked me to do it in Doha airport. At Doha airport they told me it was too late and it cannot be done. ",0,1
1441,"  Flew 1st March 2022 on brand new aircrafts, B787-9 and A350-1000, respectively. Flights on time. Ticket purchase, upgrade by miles (2nd leg), ground services, ticket changes went smooth. I had to change a simple economy ticket 4 times. Only once I was charged additional (minimal charge). Check-in in CPH easy and quick getting all 3 boarding passes at once. This, despite I faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond Singapore to Papua New Guinea. Their cooperation with partner Air Niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief. QR respect their elite members on ground as well as on board – for this trip there were no let-downs or real issues – their call centre was excellent, decisional, and cooperative. Lounge experiences: QR uses now the Eventyr Lounge in CPH which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used. Further, it is situated in non-Schengen area 3 Minutes from boarding gate. The Eventyr lounge is good, likely the best in Copenhagen - but it is still below world class. The best is the views, service, showers, and draught beer presence. Hot food only provides 1 dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse. No champagne and poor wines. They should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge. In Doha, the Al Mourjan Lounge is back to previous (pre-Corona) standards – lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming. Good showers and very good relax/working options. CPH-DOH: I was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so I could spread out with my things. Free WiFi for 1 hour granted, it worked well. Stewardess(es) were of high quality. Food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago. Sparkling wine (cava) offered in economy. The 2 wines were good. The new beers to replace the Heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull, industrial lagers (Budwiser and Stella Artois). Arrived in Doha well pampered and in a splendid mood. DOH-SIN (night-flight) in business: Embarking in Doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride. The Q-suites in business class are in my view completely overrated. These micro-cabins deprive passengers contact, air and view. Window access poor from those seats forward directed. If one sits backwards oriented, the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me. Seats and beds were excellent. The IFE is world class with updated movies, huge selection options, and the best I have ever encountered. Huge soft touch monitors. Smooth travel, reliable airline, flights on time. FAs excellent, 2 kinds: well-trained caretakers and less trained food-bringers. High class dining though without true dinner. The food was good but just “light, cold dinner snacks”. Cold lobster bites dont quite make it. Breakfast better, but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty. Coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class. Drinks were World-class: 2 champagnes and 6 wines offered – all expensive and of high quality. Bollinger 2006 rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best I have had for long. One quality beer, Leffe Blonde, was outstanding. Pyjamas and Amenity kit given out.",0,-1
1446,"  My congratulations to the Qatar Airways staff for maintaining excellence in their service. I would also like to express my appreciation to the Johannesburg Qatar Airways check in staff who handled the check in very well and very professionally. Once all required documents were submitted, I was checked in within a few minutes. I wish to express my gratitude tp the airline crew on both flights for their professionalism, and excellent service and for the excellent meals provided. Everything went well in terms of safe take offs and safe landings. I received my suitcases in Istanbul. I highly recommend Qatar Airways to anyone who would like affordability with excellence.",0,1
1461,"  We flew on 23rd November out of Adelaide with Qatar and the experience was absolutely wonderful. The staff were so helpful, we had loads of space, brilliant onboard entertainment and enjoyed the whole flight. Food was really good, and excellent choices, when I had my nighttime nip of whiskey they gave me a large measure and made a special trip to see if I wanted another drink. The plane was fairly quiet so after take of the staff assisted all in spreading out and getting a row each to make it comfortable. I will only fly Qatar now out of Adelaide. I personally would like to thank Qatar Airways for continuing to support Australia even when our national carrier stopped all international flights, it was the only real option to fly out of Adelaide.",0,-1
1466,"  I was booked to fly from London to Singapore via Doha but never got on the plane. 5 days before my flight, I started experiencing Covid symptoms and lateral flow tests showed faint positive results. Tried changing my flight under Manage trips on Qatar's site but with the same result; various options are displayed on the calendar but I selected one, the page would indicate 'There are no flights matching your search.' I phoned Qatar's UK helpline more than 15 times over several days and downloaded the Rebtel app to call its Doha line. The UK line went dead after I selected the option to speak to customer service and I remained on hold for more than an hour when calling its overseas hotline. I reached out on Twitter multiple times and all I got was an automated response telling me to call the helpline when I'd already made it clear I'd tried numerous times before and failed to get through. I did not show up for my flight and have not heard from Qatar.  In this era of Covid where travel plans are subject to change due to a volatile situation, travellers need assurance that they can change their flights. ",0,-1
1478,"  Without a doubt, Qatar Airways is 5 stars. Cabin crew is professional, caring and attentive. Airport is organised, clear signage and fantastic restaurants and Lounges. My only comment is to improve delayed flight information. Fantastic 5 star Airline.",0,-1
1485,"  Due to typhoon, my flight from Hong Kong has to be delayed to the next day. They right away informed me via app notification, email, and a phone call (following day business hour). It really put my mind at ease. They changed to an aircraft fitted with Q suite, which is like flying first class. Due to the delay, business class cabin was quite full, but it didn't affect the high level of service. Welcome drinks, pyjama sets, toiletry bag and all. Due to the pandemic, there was no magazines or any reading materials. However, there were printed menu and wine list. Crew wear a face mask. Food was served course by course in generous portion, there was no signs of any cost cutting. Inflight wifi was fast and steady too, only cost USD10 for the entire flight. Qsuite is one of the very best business class seats in the current market. The door gives you an excellent level of privacy. Comfortable large seat with sufficient storage space and comfortable for sleeping position. Throughout the flight crew presence is good, very pro active, they always come around and see if anyone needs a drink or so. A truly wonderful 9 hours just flew by, a very smooth landing. Plane was parked on tarmac, we had to be bussed to the gate. Biz customers get their own bus. Connecting in Doha is a bliss, with security procedures simplified. Fantastic huge Al Mourjan lounge with nice shower facilities and plenty to eat and get a rest. Next flight was on their new 787, fitted with new seats that also come with individual doors! Once again, meal was delicious and plenty, same excellent service all the way to Vienna. It really was one of the top best flight experiences I've ever had, especially after having stayed put for 18 months. It was a wonderful way to come back to traveling again.",0,-1
1488,"  The food on this flight was really poor. Lunch was a tough veal chop in gravy, desert a ""gooey chocolate and cherry cake with whipped cream but it was served hard, cold and with a miserly speck of cream.  The Qsuite is great of course, but Air France inflight dining is far superior. In flight entertainment is ok, but I  don't like movie vision and audio being censored. ",0,-1
1491," This is my fourth time flying Qatar in business class, I have flown Qatar in the economy a few times in the past. While the experience of the flying economy was always great, flying business class takes it to a totally new level. I have flown business class with Emirates and American before, but none of them come even close to what Qatar offers. To start off, Qatar is the only airline that offers on-demand dining, it feels like I am in a 5-star restaurant, the food quality and the in-flight service are always superb, the staff both ground and in-flight are well trained and very professional. I am positive the business class experience in Qatar is better than most airlines first-class service. On my last flight, I chose a lobster dish for my dinner, I can honestly say it was better than any other lobster dish I have tried in many fancy restaurants. Last but not the least, the lounge at Doha airport is one of the best I have ever experienced, from the shower facility to the quality of the food, simply amazing. Please keep it up and I will always pick Qatar over any other airline.",0,1
1498,"  We were originally scheduled to fly SFO-DOH-MEL however due to Australian passenger arrival caps, the DOH-MEL sector was cancelled and QR offered to reroute us into BNE two days after our original departure date. This was sincerely appreciated, particularly given our experience with other carriers flying into Australia who cancelled close to departure without any help in rescheduling or rerouting. As always, the QR experience was top notch. The QSuite and bedding were extremely comfortable, food very good, wine list outstanding and cabin crew service exemplary. Check-in and transit in Doha were seamless. I was a big fan of QR before this experience, however the way in which they handled our re-accommodated into Brisbane has now earned them my loyalty. A stark contrast to other carriers flying into Australia during the pandemic.",0,1
1531,"  This was our first time flying since the pandemic and with 2 children under the age of 2. Our flight attendants from Auckland to Brisbane to Doha were very friendly and helpful with keeping our 2 year old occupied and also ensuring our 2 month old was comfortable. The food was delicious. I highly recommend flying with Qatar Airways, thank you for making our trip enjoyable.",0,1
1558,"  My flight was just wonderful. I've never experienced anything like it. The staff was friendly and very attentive. The food was excellent. My seat was very spacious and comfortable. The amenities were outstanding. Everything worked. There was room for everything in the overhead bin. The aircraft was clean. The rest rooms were cleaned on a regular basis. In the age of covid I felt totally safe. I highly recommend this airline to others. As a side note, I had never noticed Qatar Airways prior to this trip. I usually fly another airline when I go to South Africa. Now, I am looking at the their routes on their websites to see where I can plan another trip. I really enjoyed my flight and look forward to flying with them again.",0,1

1587,"  I wanted to compliment the cabin crew for their extraordinary service on our flight QR744. We were relocating to Singapore and were travelling BOS-DOH-SIN and the long journey was made comfortable by the crew of QR 744 and 942. Service requires a lot of resilience can be such a thankless job, I write to you because your efforts put us at so much ease in our transcontinental move. These are tough times and we appreciate the care they provide amidst all that, putting their best self forward albeit at a personal health risk. We thoroughly enjoyed the Qsuite in QR744 and are grateful the team for allowing me and my spouse to move into middle seats. Really appreciate it, it made the 12 hour journey a lot more welcome. We hope that this feedback reaches the right people and they continue to do amazing work. This was the second time I flew Qatar Airways and it now certainly is my favourite airline to fly with.",0,1
1597,"  I pretty much enjoyed the trip. The precautions taken against covid-19 were very much advanced and puts you at a sense of peace during the whole trip. Though the flight was almost full however the team was very helpful and you do feel at ease with any request, the hosts even remembered and served me a request while at the busy period of boarding. Food was amazing, they had also a precaution set of several items against covid 19. No one removed their mask during the entire trip and also had a face shield unless they were eating. Leg space and seats were really comfortable. The entertainment content is amazing which made the time pass, i loved the fact that the screens are large compared to other airlines and i was able to recharge my phone as well and had internet access during most of the trip for Free! Overall i was pretty impressed honestly and really enjoyed my trip.",0,-1
