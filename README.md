# MannheimWMProject
Web Mining Project IE671 UMannheim 

This project code is divided in the following sections:
1_EDA - Initial Exploration, Data Preprocessing and Visualisations
2_Lexicon-Based - Usage of Lexicon-Based models to further explore our data
3_LogReg_RandForest - Application of ML models Logistic Regression and Random Forest to our data
4_BERT - Application of the pretrained model BERT to our data
5_LSTM - Application of an LSTM architecture to our data
6_ML_XGBoost - Application of ML model XGBoost to our data

1 & 2 consist of data exploration and preprocessing
3 to 6 consist of the application of diverse models, aiming to make predictions

This Repository also contains 2 py files, preprocessing.py and lexicon_based, which include functions used throughout the project.

The Initial Data consists of the airlines_reviews.csv, which after preprocessed was exported as processed_data. The file processed_data was used as input in notebooks 3-6.

In this project, our group split tasks, but every member of the group was available to answer questions and solve problems that could arise.
